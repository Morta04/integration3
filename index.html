        <h2 class="hero-image_intro">The story of Christophe Plantin - a 16th century printer that went against the religious wars of his time to spread
        knowledge around the world.</h2>

    <section class="first-section">
      <h1 class="first-section_title">Who is Plantin?</h1>
      <h2 class="first-section_headline"><strong>C</strong>hristophe Plantin was born around 1520 in Saint-Avertin, France. Plantin started his journey by being a book binding
      apprentice.</h2>
      <p class="first-section_text1">After his apprenticeship he <strong>studied in Paris</strong>, where he learned 6-7 languages, which resulted in him coming to the
      realisation that the <strong>best way to teach people</strong> was by reading books, but mass <strong>manufacturing of books wasn’t as easy</strong> as it
      is today.</p>
      <img class="timeline-card1" src="./src/assets/mobile/franceCollage-timeline_mobile.png">
      <img class="first-section_france" src="./src/assets/mobile/franceCollage-mobile.png">
      <p class="first-section_text2">After Plantin bought up everything he needed, he realised that <strong>Paris wasn’t the correct city to reside in</strong> if he intended
      to reach people internationally. <strong>His solution?</strong> Moving to Antwerp, Belgium in 1548.</p>
      <img class="first-section_antwerp" src="./src/assets/mobile/antwerpCollage-mobile.png">
      <p class="first-section_text3">Antwerp in the 16th century was a trading hub, as it is situated on a river that was suitable for ships to sail through.
      This move did pay off for Plantin but also caused him quite a few hardships</p>

    <section class="second-section">
      <h1 class="second-section_title">Struggle to keep afloat</h1>
      <img class="second-section_plantin" src="./src/assets/mobile/woundCollage-mobile.png">
      <img class="second-section_dagger" src="./src/assets/mobile/daggerCollage-mobile.png">
      <h2 class="second-section_headline">The issues started when Plantin was attacked by thieves, who mistakenly thought that the basket he carried had something
      valuable. The thieves beat Plantin almost to death, this resulted in him losing mobility in one of his arms.</h2>
      <p class="second-section_text1">Because of his impairment, he could not continue being a bookbinder, so Plantin focused mostly on printing and selling
      his works.</p>
      <img class="second-section_print" src="./src/assets/mobile/printCollage-mobile.png">
      <p class="second-section_text2">One of his first opportunities to prove his abilities was when the guild “House of Love”, which he was a member of,
      wanted to spread their critical views of the Catholic church. Plantin took up the job.</p>
      <p class="second-section_text3">Being critical of the Catholic church in the 16th century wasn’t anything new, but was punishable by death, since most
      European countries were ruled by Catholic monarchs.</p>
      <img class="second-section_philip" src="./src/assets/mobile/philipCollage-mobile.png">
      <p class="second-section_text4">The situation in Antwerp was no different as it was under the rule of Philip the II of Spain - a Catholic. Not so
      surprisingly most of “House of Love” were accused of heresy in 1562.</p>
      <p class="secons-section_text5">Some were executed, while others managed to run away. Plantin was one the lucky ones as he was in Paris at the time of
      the raid.</p>
      <img class="second-section_heresy" src="./src/assets/mobile/heresyCollage-mobile.png">
      <img class="second-section_hands" src="./src/assets/mobile/handsCollage-mobile.png">
      <p class="second-section_text6">In September 1563, he returned to Antwerp, where all his furniture had, in the meantime, been sold to the public.</p>
      <p class="second-section_text7">But presumably the creditors were friends of Plantin, who managed to ensure that the government did not impound his
      property. They subsequently became his partners.</p>
      <img class="second-section_stronghold" src="./src/assets/mobile/strongholdCollage-mobile.png">
      <p class="second-section_text8">Everything seemed to go well for Plantin... that is until 1567, when all of his collaborators, who were convicted
      Calvinists, fled to the Netherlands.</p>
      <p class="second-section_text9">But the real danger to Plantin lay in Vianen, near Utrecht. In this Calvinist stronghold, Plantin secretly helped to
      establish an anti-Spanish printing works. This act of high treason could have cost him his head.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="third-section">
      <h1 class="third-section_title">Staying alive</h1>
      <h2 class="third-section_headline">To clear himself of all suspicion, Plantin sang the praises of the Catholic Church in letters to powerful protectors in
      this period.</h2>
      <p class="third-section_text1">He developed a plan that he suspected would be of interest to the ultra-Catholic King Philip II: a scholarly edition of
      the Biblical texts that would be the largest polyglot Bible of the 16th century.</p>
      <img class="third-section_biblia" src="./src/assets/mobile/bibliaCollage-mobile.png">
      <p class="third-section_text2">This worked a well, so well in fact, that he received the title of King Philip II’s main printer. Ironically,  7 years
      later Plantin would receive the honour of being the printer for Antwerps city council, which was Calvinist at the time.</p>
      <p class="third-section_text3">Unfortunately,  the good times didn’t last for very long, in 1576 Antwerp experienced the Spanish Fury, which took the
      lives of 17000 men, women and children.</p>
      <img class="third-section_siege" src="./src/assets/mobile/siegeCollage-mobile.png">
      <p class="third-section_text4">Plantin was caught between the different parties: to the outside world, he remained a Catholic, yet he also printed
      anti-Spanish pamphlets and works.</p>
      <img class="third-section_leiden" src="./src/assets/mobile/leidenCollage-mobile.png">
      <p class="third-section_text4">The Spanish attempted to take over Antwerp, so Plantin tried to run to Leiden, where he worked for Leiden university.
      But he didn’t stay for too long and returned to Antwerp in 1586.</p>
      <p class="third-section_text5">Unbeknownst to Plantin, both his business and Antwerp would never be the same during his lifetime. Christophe Plantin
      died on July 1st 1589, his printing house of inherited by his son-in-law Jan I Moretus.</p>

    <section class="fourth-section">
      <h1 class="fourth-section_title">What was left?</h1>
      <p class="fourth-section_text1">After Plantins death, the printing house was managed by the Moretus family starting with Jan I Moretus and ending with
      Edward Moretus, who sold the printing house to the city of Antwerp.</p>
      <img class="fourth-section_lilies" src="./src/assets/mobile/liliesCollage-mobile.png">
